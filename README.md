# House Prices in Perth Web App

## Overview

This is a Python-based web application built using [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/). It visualizes house prices in Perth using an interactive dashboard and includes a simple prediction tool for estimating house prices based on selected parameters.

This is the first web application I have developed using Python, and it serves as a great learning experience for working with data visualization and web development.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Displays house prices across Perth using a heatmap.
- **Filters**: Allows users to filter by suburb, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
- **Price Trends**: Visualizes price trends over time.
- **Prediction Tool**: A simple estimator to predict house prices based on user input.
- **CSV Download**: Option to download filtered data for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Plotly Dash**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Dash Components** (for interactivity)
